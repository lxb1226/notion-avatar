## Introduction: The Silent Power of Color

In our digital age, color has become one of the fastest and most direct ways we communicate information. When someone first sees your avatar, their brain responds emotionally to color within mere milliseconds. This response is often more primitive and powerful than reactions to text or other visual elements.

Scientific research shows that human color perception is not merely a visual experience, but a deep psychological and physiological response. In avatar design, the intelligent application of color psychology principles can help you establish the right impression immediately, communicate your intended message, and stand out in today's competitive digital environment.

## Best Practices for Color Combinations

### The 60-30-10 Color Proportion Rule

This is a widely adopted color allocation principle in the design world:

**60% Main Color:**
- Occupies the primary area of the avatar
- Usually choose relatively neutral or industry-appropriate colors
- Sets the overall style tone

**30% Supporting Color:**
- Used for important secondary elements
- Forms harmonious or contrasting relationships with main color
- Adds visual hierarchy

**10% Accent Color:**
- Used for highlighting the most important details
- Usually choose relatively bright colors
- Attracts attention to key elements

**Practical Application Example:**
- Main Color: Dark blue (background and primary clothing)
- Supporting Color: Light gray (face and secondary elements)
- Accent Color: Orange (glasses or accessories)

### Ensuring Readability Through Contrast

**Importance Explanation:**
Adequate contrast not only improves visual effects but is also a basic requirement for accessible design.

**Contrast Standards:**
- **Minimum Requirement**: 4.5:1 (meets WCAG AA standards)
- **Recommended Standard**: 7:1 (meets WCAG AAA standards)
- **Testing Tools**: Use online contrast checkers for verification

**Implementation Methods:**
- Regularly check contrast during the design process
- Test display effects on different devices and environments
- Provide readability assurance for users with visual impairments

### Balance Between Background and Subject

**Design Principles:**
Background should support rather than interfere with subject expression.

**Background Color Selection:**

- **Gradient Background**: Adds depth while maintaining modernity
- **Pattern Background**: Use cautiously, avoid distracting attention

**Balance Techniques:**
- Ensure sufficient contrast between subject and background
- Avoid visual conflicts between background and subject colors
- Test effects when scaled down

### Methods to Avoid Color Conflicts

**Common Color Conflicts:**

- Verify effects through user testing
